Initialize the clusters

Randomly divide the data into k parts. Each part represents an initial "cluster".

Compute the mean of each part. Each mean represents an initial cluster center.

Update the clusters

Re-assign each record to the cluster with the nearest center (using Euclidean distance).

Compute the new cluster centers by taking the mean of the records in each cluster.

Keep repeating step 2 until the clusters don't change after the update.
